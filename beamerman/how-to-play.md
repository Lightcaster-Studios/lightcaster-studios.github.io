## Controls
- **ESC:** Opens the menu
- **WASD:** Movement
- **Space Bar/Left Click:** Shoots a lazer

## How to Win
Shoot lazers and kill your enemies!
Break crates to get powerups!
You only have 5 lives!

**Mayhem Mode:** When time runs out, the floor will fall beneath your feet. Dropping off the arena is an instant death!

## Powerups
## Permanent Powerups
These powerups give you a permanent boost!

- **Speed++:** This increases your movement speed.
- **Range++:** This increases how far your lazer travels.
- **Reflect++:** This increases the number of times your lazer reflects on mirrors.

## Temporary Powerups
These powerups expire after a short time period. But until then, they'll protect you for **one** hit! 
You can only have one at once. If you pick up a new temporary powerup while the previous one is active, your previous one gets overridden.

- **TempArmor:** This acts like a wall, protecting you from the next hit.
- **GlassArmor:** This turns you into glass, making the next hit pass through you.
- **MirroredArmor:** This turns you into a mirror, making the next hit reflect off you.
