## How to Win
Shoot lazers and kill your enemies!

Break crates to get powerups!

You only have 8 lives!

**Mayhem Mode:** When time runs out, the floor will fall beneath your feet. Dropping off the arena is an instant death!

## Scoring
Players are able to gain bonus points through a variety of actions.

Try to use more reflected lazers against your opponents to earn more points and go for a high score!

## Powerups
### Permanent Powerups
These powerups give you a permanent boost!

- **Speed++:** This increases your movement speed.
- **Range++:** This increases how far your lazer travels.
- **Reflect++:** This increases the number of times your lazer reflects on mirrors.
- **Drone++:** This increases the number of drones you can place at one time, allowing you to fire multiple lazers.

### Temporary Powerups
These powerups expire after a short time period. But until then, they'll protect you for **one** hit! 
You can only have one at once. If you pick up a new temporary powerup while the previous one is active, your previous one gets overridden.

- **TempArmor:** This acts like a wall, protecting you from the next hit.
- **GlassArmor:** This turns you into glass, making the next hit pass through you.
- **MirroredArmor:** This turns you into a mirror, making the next hit reflect off you.

### Instant Powerups
These powerups have an instant effect on the field.

- **Explod-o-mat:** This summons an explosive barrel onto a random position on the field. Beware of its explosion!

## Environment Objects
These are objects on the field that the players can interact with.

- **Destruction Barrels:** There are 4 of these around the map. Destroying it will cause the adjacent blocks surrounding the barrel to fall off the map.
- **Point Becons:** This object spawns a point orb occasionally that can be picked up by the player. Picking up the orb gives the player bonus points, so collect this to get a high score!
