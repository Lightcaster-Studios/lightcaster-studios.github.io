# Major Update

Today we would like to share with you our first major update for Beamerman!

We will be talking about our new UI and our multiplayer feature!

## UI

In our new build, we have re-designed our UI to give it more flair!

**Settings menu**<br>
We have also added a Settings menu for you to change the game to a preferable resolution and the right sound volume.

**New Power-Up Icons**<br>
We improved on our Power-Up icons to add more visual clarity too! We decided to create 3D models based on the icon so that it stands out more to the player.

We are excited to bring Multiplayer to Beamerman! We have incorporated Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer so that you can play Beamerman with your friends!

For Online Multiplayer, we enabled the game to connect using Steam! Search for your friends' lobbies using your Steam names.
